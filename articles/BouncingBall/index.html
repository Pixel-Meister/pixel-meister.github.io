	<h2>Bouncing Ball</h2>
	<p>To kick things off, I'd like to start with a bouncing ball. It demonstrates some entry-level coding concepts like variables, modifying them, and funtions.</p>
	<p>I'm using p5.js to handle animation; however, I think as long as concepts are there you can apply this to whatever language and library you choose.</p>
	<p>First, let's set up the scene. We draw an ellipse on the screen.</p>
	<p>In p5, there are two main functions. There's setup, which is code that runs continuosly. You can specify otherwise, like having a loop or having draw only run once.</p>
	<p>Looking at the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js</a> reference for 2D objects we can see that the ellipse command sounds perfect. It has x and y coordinates and height and width arguments.</p>
	<p>Sweet, so in our setup function we can set our canvas to the default 400x400 and we'll use the ellipse function in the draw funtion to create our circle.</p>
	<div id="ballSketch1"></div>
	<p>Next, we'll try moving it. Since draw runs multiple times, we can change the X or Y positions each time draw is run.</p>
	<div id="ballSketch2"></div>
</article>
<script>
	const instance = (p) => {
		let canvasX = 400;
		let canvasY = 400;
		let xPos = canvasX/2;
		let yPos = canvasY/2;
		p.setup = function(){
			p.background(51);
			p.createCanvas(canvasX,canvasY);
		}
		p.draw = function() {
			//p.background = 0
			p.noFill();
			p.fill(255);
			p.ellipse(xPos/2,yPos/2,10,10)
		}
	}
	let p5One = new p5(instance, "ballSketch1");
	let p5Two = new p5(instance,"ballSketch2");
