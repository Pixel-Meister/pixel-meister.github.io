	<h2>Spreading Colors</h2>
	<p>Ah, early 2020. While it was a good time, it predated awesome animations like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/">this one</a> by the Washington Post that used Javascript animations to demonstrate how diseases are slowed.</p>
	<p>What I'd particularly like to focus on is the little bouncing dot animation where they have a crowd of circles bumping into each other spreading different colors and changing.</p>
